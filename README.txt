*************************************
*1. Intro                           *
*************************************
Shooterfornaow is a game in progress, and is therefor not
finished. We are working to remove bugs and add features
but have not been successful in adding everything we want
before this 'release'.

However, we have added the most we can, and we hope that
you enjoy our little game!

The purpos of the game is to get as much points as you can
untill you die. The highscore is shown after you die.

- The player turns red when you take damage
- Zombies blink red when they are hit
- When you kill zombies you get better score
- Highscore is only shown after you die.

*************************************
*4. Known bugs                      *
*************************************
- Holding crosshair close to the characters center makes the bullets go the wrong way
- Running off the edge doesn't kill you, you will only fall forever
- Zombies will glitch if they are allowed to stand still on you
- Settings that are loaded from a seperate file for Zombies/players sometimes place their heads on... slightly.... wierd........
- Kuro gets fat when you change color
- Bullets originates too far away from the gun. Except on the weapon 'sub'.
- The handgun in totally bugged...!


*************************************
*5. Unused files and variables      *
*************************************
Due to this being a work-in-progress, we have some files and variables throughout the project that
has not been utilized in this version

Unused files:
- GUI/Textbox.cs
- Modding/CreateWeaponMenu.cs
- Modding/CreateWeaponStatusMenu.cs

There are also alot of textures not in use, which increases the overall size of the project.
In the textfiles that we import settings from, you have a lot of variables
that currently aren't in use. In future versions it will be used.


*************************************
*6. Project information             *
*************************************
It is worth noting that this project, although using XNA, is made to be ported over to another platform
using a custom gameengine that Henrik Christensen has made. That is aslo the reason we have chosen not
to use XNA's features in some places.

We hope this won't have anything to say on our overall grade.
